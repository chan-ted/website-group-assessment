                        <p class="p-2">Mike Snider of USA Today wrote that Vice City "raised the bar for video games", citing its interactivity, violence, and soundtrack.[122] Kotaku's Luke Plunkett and PC Magazine's Jeffrey L. Wilson both named Vice City the best game in the series, with the former naming it the "perfect Grand Theft Auto experience".[123][124] The readers of Official UK PlayStation Magazine named Vice City the fourth-greatest PlayStation title ever released.[125] In 2006 Vice City appeared on Japanese magazine Famitsu's readers' list of top 100 games; it was one of the only Western titles on the list.[126] Art director Aaron Garbut felt that, alongside its predecessor Grand Theft Auto III and successor San Andreas, Vice City led the trend of open world games.[31] A new rendition of Vice City is set to return in Grand Theft Auto VI (2025).[127]</p>

                        <p class="p-2">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was released for Windows on 13 May 2003 in North America and 16 May in Europe,[128] supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.[129] Vice City was bundled with Grand Theft Auto III in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack, released on the Xbox on 4 November 2003 in North America[130] and 2 January 2004 in Europe.[131] The Xbox version featured a custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, polygon models, and reflections over the previous ports.[132] Double Pack was later bundled with San Andreas in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, released in October 2005.[133] Analysts believed that the game would eventually release on GameCube,[134] though it never materialised.[135] The Trilogy was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010.[136]</p>
                        <p class="p-2">For its tenth anniversary in 2012, Vice City was ported to mobile devices by War Drum Studios, building on the Windows version with enhanced visuals and a customisable layout.[64] It was released for iOS devices on 6 December,[137] for Android on 12 December following a delay due to technical issues,[138] and for Fire OS on 15 May 2014.[139] An emulated version of Vice City was released on the PlayStation 3 on 30 January 2013 via the PlayStation Network's PS2 Classics;[140] another emulated version was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5 December 2015, upscaled to 1080p and with support for Trophies.[141] A remastered version of The Trilogy, subtitled The Definitive Edition, was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11 November 2021,[142] and for Android and iOS on 14 December 2023.[143] The original game was removed from digital retailers in preparation for The Definitive Edition,[142] but later restored as a bundle on the Rockstar Store.[144]</p>
                        <p class="p-2">A core team of six fans reverse-engineered the game and released it as an executable in December 2020, having worked on it since May; titled reVC, the project allows the game to be unofficially ported to platforms such as Nintendo Switch, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U.[145][146] Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown for the project in February 2021.[147] In April, Theo, a New Zealand-based developer who maintained a fork of the source code, filed a counter-notice on GitHub, claiming that the code does not contain any original work owned by Take-Two; per DMCA rules regarding disputes, Theo's content was restored after two weeks.[148] On 10 June 2021, the team behind reVC filed a counter-notice; per DMCA rules regarding disputes, the source code was restored after two weeks.[149] In September 2021, Take-Two filed a lawsuit in California against the programmers, asserting that the projects constitute copyright infringement.[150]</p>
                        <p class="p-2">A team of Russian modders released an unofficial port of the game to Grand Theft Auto IV's engine in January 2025, aiming to address perceived issues with The Definitive Edition.[151][152] A DMCA complaint by Take-Two resulted in the deletion of the mod's trailer and YouTube channel, though some journalists noted the 2022 decree protecting Russian companies from copyright enforcement by Western firms (as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine) may shield the mod and team from legal action by Take-Two.[153][154] Vice City's technical director, Obbe Vermeij, defended Take-Two's decision, opining that the mod "directly competes" with The Definitive Edition, though he acknowledged the takedown "would be easier to swallow if [Rockstar] produced competent re-masters".[155]</p>
