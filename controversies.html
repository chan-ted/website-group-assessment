                    <p class="p-2">Similar to its predecessors, Vice City was labelled violent and explicit and considered controversial by many special interest groups.[95][96][97][98] Peter Hartlaub of SFGate noted the game's "mindless violence", but attributed it to the developers' attempt to achieve accuracy.[99] Jeremy Pope, who worked on various Rockstar games including Vice City, vowed never to work on violent games again due to their portrayal in mainstream media.[100] In Australia, the game was pre-edited to receive an MA15+ classification;[101] an uncensored version was released in the region in 2010, retaining its classification.[102]</p>

                        <span class="col-12 col-md-8">In November 2003, the Haitian Centers Council and Haitian Americans for Human Rights staged a protest in New York publicly criticising the game, contending that it invited the player to harm Haitian immigrants and claiming that it depicted Haitians as "thugs, thieves and drug dealers".[103] In response, Rockstar issued a press release apologising and acknowledging the concern, but insisted that the violence should be taken within the context of the game, which also contains violence towards other ethnic groups.[104] When New York mayor Michael Bloomberg threatened distributor Take-Two Interactive with legal action, the company apologised and removed offensive statements from future copies of the game.[105] In January 2004, North Miami's majority Haitian-American council filed an ordinance to ban the selling or renting of violent games to anyone under 18 without parental permission. The proposal, apparently sparked by Vice City, was supported by North Miami mayor Josaphat Celestin, who stated "We don't believe the First Amendment was written to protect those who want to incite violence".[106] The case was later downgraded from federal court to state court.[107]</span>

                    <p class="p-2">On 7 June 2003, 18-year-old Devin Moore shot and killed two Alabamian police officers and a dispatcher before fleeing in a patrol car; he was later apprehended. In statements to police, Moore reportedly said "Life is like a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime".[108] A $600 million lawsuit was filed against Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, Sony Computer Entertainment, GameStop, and Wal-Mart, claiming that Moore frequently played Vice City and that his experience with the game led him to commit the crimes. The plaintiffs' attorney, Jack Thompson, claimed the graphic nature of the game caused Moore to commit the murders.[109] Thompson removed himself from the case Strickland v. Sony in November 2005[110] after being scrutinised by the judge for unprofessional conduct.[111] In March 2006, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case.[112]</p>
                    <p class="p-2">In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million lawsuit against Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment.[113][114] The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico.[115] Posey's defence team argued that he was abused by his father[116] and was taking Zoloft at the time of the killings.[117] The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City.[118] The case was dismissed in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.[119]</p>
                    <p class="p-2">In July 2017, the Psychic Readers Network (PRN) sued Rockstar over the character named Auntie Poulet, alleging similarities between the character and Youree Harris, who voiced the character.[120] Brandon J. Huffman, a lawyer for Odin Law and Media, noted that PRN's lawsuit faced challenges due to the timing of the lawsuit, as the Eleventh Circuit's statute of limitations for copyright infringement is three years; the lawsuit was filed almost 15 years after the game's release. Huffman added that Take-Two could also claim parody or settle out of court, but that it was unlikely to do either initially.[121] </p>
