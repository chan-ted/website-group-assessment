The firearms include weapons such as the Colt Python, an M60 machine gun and a Minigun.[6][7] The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle and rocket launcher. In addition, the game's combat allows the player to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle.[8][9] A wide variety of weapon options can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.[10]

                <p class="p-2">In combat, auto-aim can be used as assistance against enemies.[11] Should the player take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups.[12] Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.[13] When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and the player respawns at the nearest hospital while losing all weapons and armour and some of their money.[5] If the player commits crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD), which increases as the player commits more crimes. On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level, and the higher the level, the greater the response for law enforcement[5] (for example, at the maximum six-star level, police helicopters and military swarm to lethally dispatch players).[8]</p>
                <p class="p-2">During the story, Tommy meets characters from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may engage in activities such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, a paramedic service and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards.[9] As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored.[14] There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a pornographic film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property has a number of missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.[8]</p>
                <h3 class="p-2 mt-5" id="subHeading1" >Setting</h3>
                <p class="p-2">The game is set in 1986 in fictional Vice City, which is based heavily on the city of Miami.[27] Vice City previously appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase.[28] They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City.[16] The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer Leslie Benzies describes as "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath".[18] Sam Houser called it "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime ... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time".[29] The team intended to make Vice City a "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like "life still goes on" while the character is inside a building.[30]</p>
                <p class="p-2">The game's look, particularly the clothing and vehicles, reflect its 1980s setting. Many themes are borrowed from the crime films Scarface (1983) and Carlito's Way (1993),[27] the latter for its characterisation and portrayal of nuanced criminals. The television series Miami Vice (1984–1989) was also a major influence and was regularly watched by the team throughout development.[31] Art director Aaron Garbut used the series as a reference point for emulating neon lighting.[29] In recreating a 1980s setting, the team found it "relatively painless" due to the distinct culture of the time period and the team's familiarity with the era.[31] The art team was provided with large volumes of research, as well as reference photographs taken by other members of the development team. The team organised field research trips to Miami shortly after completing the development of Grand Theft Auto III, splitting into small teams and observing the streets.[31][32]</p>
                <h3 class="p-2 mt-5" id="subHeading2">Story and characters</h3>
                <div class="row p-2">
                    <p class="col-12 col-sm-8">The team spent time "solving [the] riddle" of a speaking protagonist, a notable departure from Grand Theft Auto III's silent protagonist Claude.[34] Ray Liotta portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti and described the role as challenging: "You're creating a character that's not there before ... It's so intensive". While recording his performance, the team used blue screen to allow Liotta to visualise "how it's gonna move".[33] The team strove to make the player feel a "real affinity" for Tommy by prioritising the game's narrative.[16] Dan Houser described Tommy as "strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive".[32] Director Navid Khonsari found Liotta occasionally difficult to work with.[35] Sam Houser said, "In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work".[36]</p>

                </div>
                <p class="p-2">The majority of the game's animations were original, with only a few borrowed from Grand Theft Auto III. For the characters, the team used motion capture and stop motion animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements use a combination of both techniques. The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, due in part to the variety of models.[37] Pedestrian character models use skins in Vice City, allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters. There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of polygons and textures found in Grand Theft Auto III.[27][32] The increased polygons also impacted the character physics, improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy.[38] Some character models and storylines were inspired by films such as The Godfather (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by action television shows of the 1980s.[39] The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of Miami Vice's Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.[40]</p>
                <h3 class="p-2 mt-5" id="subHeading3">Sound design and music production</h3>
                <p class="p-2">The game features 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue, four times the amount in Grand Theft Auto III.[32] It contains over 90 minutes of cutscenes and nine hours of music,[32] with more than 113 songs and commercials.[41] The team enjoyed the challenge of creating the game's soundtrack, particularly in contrast to Grand Theft Auto III's music, which Sam Houser described as "clearly satirical and its own thing".[17] In developing the radio stations, the team wanted to reinforce the game's setting by collating a variety of songs from the 1980s, which required extensive research.[42] The radio stations were published by Epic Records in seven albums—known collectively as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set—alongside the game in October 2002.[43][44] Vice City contains about "three times as much" talk radio as Grand Theft Auto III. Producer and talk show host Lazlow Jones stated that the small percentage of station listeners that actually call in are "insane"; in Vice City, the developers "bumped it up a notch", emphasising the extremity. Dan Houser felt that the talk stations give depth to the game world.[45]</p>
